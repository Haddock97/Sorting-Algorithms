# Sorting-Algorithms
A compilation of 5 sorting algorithms with a menu for convenience. 
I've written selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and two recursive sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort. 
The goal of this was to remember sorting algorithms taught from a previous class I had taken and to condense all the sorting algorithms
into a single file with a UI that will allow users to select between different algorithms conveniently. 
Note: The lack of comments explaining important details besides basic labeling of components is because sorting algorithms are widespread
across the internet and usually are pretty basic conceptually (except for recursive methods), for algorithms with proper commenting please 
view the individual sorting algorithm files.
