# Sorting-Algorithms
A compilation of 5 sorting algorithms with a menu for convenience. 
I've written selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, and two recursive sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort. 
The goal of this was to remember sorting algorithms taught from a previous class I had taken and to condense all the sorting algorithms
into a single file with a UI that will allow users to select between different algorithms conveniently. 

Note: The lack of comments are due to how widespread and available sorting algorithms are across the internet. Most of these algs are basic enough that the code I've written is very similar to geek2geek and other websites's implementation. 

UPDATE 1: Added 6th method of counting sort. A cool algorithm I learned that runs in O(N+K) time. 

UPDATE 2: Added a 7th test method that can be ignored. Exists only for personal testing.
